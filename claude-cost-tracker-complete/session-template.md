- **Output Cost**: $0.086 (5,700 tokens × $15.00/1K)  
- **Total Session Cost**: **$0.410**
- **Cost per Hour**: $[calculated]
- **Tokens per Hour**: [calculated]

## Session Activities

### Key Accomplishments
- [X] Implemented JWT token validation middleware
- [X] Added rate limiting for auth endpoints
- [X] Created comprehensive error handling
- [X] Added security tests for token patterns

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Files Modified**: [number]
- **Lines Added**: [number] 
- **Lines Deleted**: [number]
- **Tests Added**: [number]
- **Test Coverage**: [percentage]%

### Security Considerations
- [X] Input validation implemented
- [X] Timing attack prevention
- [X] Token rotation patterns
- [X] Secure error messages

## Efficiency Analysis

### What Went Well
- Focused prompts led to efficient code generation
- Good token efficiency with high output/input ratio
- Clear context reduced back-and-forth

### Areas for Improvement
- Could have batched similar requests
- Some prompts could have been more specific
- Context switching led to repeated explanations

### Next Session Optimization
- [ ] Prepare more specific initial context
- [ ] Batch related functionality requests
- [ ] Use Haiku for simple reviews/questions
- [ ] Reserve Sonnet for complex implementation

## Development Notes

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **JWT Library**: Chose `jsonwebtoken` for RS256 support
2. **Rate Limiting**: Redis-backed sliding window approach
3. **Error Handling**: Custom error types with security context
4. **Testing Strategy**: Property-based tests for token validation

### Blockers Encountered
- [Issue description and resolution]

### Questions for Next Session
- [ ] Performance optimization for high-throughput scenarios
- [ ] Integration with existing user management system
- [ ] Deployment strategy for token key rotation

## Cost Optimization Notes

### Model Usage Strategy
- **Sonnet-4**: Complex implementation, architecture decisions
- **Haiku**: Simple questions, code formatting, quick reviews  
- **Opus**: Reserved for critical security analysis only

### Token Efficiency Tips Applied
- ✅ Used specific, focused prompts
- ✅ Provided relevant context upfront
- ✅ Batched related requests when possible
- ❌ Could reduce context switching overhead
