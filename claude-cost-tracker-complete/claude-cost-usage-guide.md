## Token Estimation Guide

### Rough Estimates
- **4 characters â‰ˆ 1 token**
- **1,000 tokens â‰ˆ 750 words**
- **Average function â‰ˆ 50-200 tokens**
- **Small module â‰ˆ 500-2,000 tokens**

### Common Usage Patterns
```bash
# Typical token ranges by activity
Simple chat/questions:     500-1,500 â†’ 300-800 tokens
Code review:               1,000-3,000 â†’ 500-1,500 tokens  
Feature implementation:    2,000-5,000 â†’ 3,000-8,000 tokens
Architecture planning:     1,500-4,000 â†’ 2,000-6,000 tokens
Security audit:           2,500-6,000 â†’ 1,000-3,000 tokens
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Model Selection
- **claude-haiku-3**: Simple questions, formatting, quick reviews ($0.25/$1.25)
- **claude-sonnet-4**: Most coding tasks, complex analysis ($3/$15)  
- **claude-opus-4**: Critical architecture, complex debugging only ($15/$75)

### Efficiency Tips
1. **Batch related requests** - Group similar tasks in one prompt
2. **Provide context upfront** - Reduce back-and-forth clarification
3. **Use specific prompts** - Avoid generic "help me with X" requests
4. **Context management** - Include relevant code/docs in initial prompt
5. **Session planning** - Define clear objectives before starting

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Development
```bash
# Start focused session
./claude-cost start "User Authentication Feature"

# Architecture planning (typically higher input tokens)
./claude-cost log 2500 3500 "Designed JWT auth architecture"

# Implementation (high output for code generation)  
./claude-cost log 1800 4200 "Implemented token validation middleware"

# Testing (moderate both directions)
./claude-cost log 1200 1800 "Added comprehensive auth tests"

# Review and refinement
./claude-cost log 900 600 "Fixed edge cases and security issues"

# End with report
./claude-cost end
```

### Workflow 2: Code Review Session
```bash
# Start review session
./claude-cost start "Security Review - Payment System"

# Initial analysis (high input to provide code context)
./claude-cost log 4500 2200 "Analyzed payment processing security"

# Detailed findings (moderate both directions)
./claude-cost log 1800 2800 "Identified 3 security vulnerabilities" 

# Recommendations (higher output for detailed suggestions)
./claude-cost log 1200 3400 "Provided security improvement recommendations"

./claude-cost end
```

### Workflow 3: Quick Debugging
```bash
./claude-cost start "Debug Session - API Errors"
./claude-cost quick debug "Fixed JWT token parsing error"
./claude-cost quick debug "Resolved database connection timeout"  
./claude-cost end
```

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Manual Tracking
Use the command-line tools manually during your Claude Code sessions.

### Option 2: Shell Integration
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
source /path/to/claude-cost-hooks.sh

# Now use aliases
claude-start "Session name"
claude-log code "What you did"
claude-end
```

### Option 3: Git Hooks
```bash
# Pre-commit hook automatically logs when you commit during a session
cp claude-cost-hooks.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Option 4: CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Track costs in CI/CD pipelines
- name: Track Claude Usage
  run: |
    ./claude-cost start "CI Review Session"
    # ... claude code commands ...
    ./claude-cost end
```

```

### Example 2: $5 Quick Review Session
```markdown  
**Session Name**: Security Code Review
**Duration**: 20 minutes  
**Total Cost**: $4.80
**Key Metrics**:
- 3,200 input tokens, 1,800 output tokens
- Efficient focused review with specific questions

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q**: Token estimates seem off  
**A**: Claude's tokenization can vary. Monitor actual usage vs estimates and adjust.

**Q**: High costs per session  
**A**: Consider breaking into smaller focused sessions, using Haiku for simple tasks.

**Q**: Reports not generating  
**A**: Check file permissions and ensure Python 3 is available.

**Q**: Git integration not working  
**A**: Ensure you're in a git repository and have proper permissions.

### Best Practices
1. **Start small**: Begin with short sessions to establish baseline costs
2. **Monitor patterns**: Review reports to identify expensive operations
3. **Optimize prompts**: More specific prompts = better efficiency
4. **Plan sessions**: Define clear objectives and scope
5. **Track trends**: Monitor cost efficiency improvements over time
